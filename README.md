This folder contains some materials that I made during preparations for meetings with Professor Jae-Ho Cheong, M.D. Ph.D in preparation for the "Quantum Technology for the SDGs" session at the 2025 Global Engagement & Empowerment Forum on Sustainable Development (GEEF). The folder includes the PPT materials I presented to the professor during the meetings, as well as the final Forum session concept note.

The Global Engagement & Empowerment Forum on Sustainable Development (GEEF) is an annual international event organized by the Institute for Global Engagement & Empowerment (IGEE) at Yonsei University and the Ban Ki-moon Centre for Global Citizens. The GEEF 2025 forum took place on March 13-14, 2025, at Yonsei University in Seoul, Republic of Korea, and brought together global leaders, experts, and stakeholders to collaborate on achieving the United Nations' 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The main event was held at the Centennial Hall and Baekyangnuri Grand Ballroom on the Sinchon Campus of Yonsei University. 

The forum was recorded in real-time from the opening ceremony to the closing ceremony, with all sessions streamed live on YouTube. The 2025 GEEF Forum is can be accessed at this link: https://www.youtube.com/@IGEEyonsei/featured
